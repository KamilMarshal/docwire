                <strong>
                    Our history of working with industry leaders in every field, combined with 10+
                    years of development, has made Docwire the longest standing, most dynamic text extraction SDK on the
                    market.

                <strong>
                    What began as your run of the mill garage band of Commodore 64 tinkerers, has now expanded to a
                    rag-tag team of developers and marketers with a bleeding passion
                    for cutting edge tech. We feel immense pride in every step we take, which is something we believe
                    shows in the quality of what we produce.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our ear-to-the-ground approach not only ensures that we supply a product that is sought after on the
                    market, but is one of, if not the most influential motivator for our actions. Solving
                    self-identified issues is one thing, but helping a client solve their own puzzle is what ultimately
                    scratches that problem-solving itch. We very much operate on a "problem first" basis, prioritizing
                    utility and faster sprints through the disposal of myopic features.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As we've continued to tinker with the SDK (as well as various consoles) we've set our eyes on a new
                    goal - Becoming the time saving backbone of digital document processing.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This vision has been the guiding hand for all of our actions, leading Docwire to secure
                    industry-leading clients such as PwC Singapore and Tausight who both dominate the finance and
                    healthcare cyber security sectors respectively.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We are now eagerly preparing for the next step in our journey. Might that be a partnership with you?
